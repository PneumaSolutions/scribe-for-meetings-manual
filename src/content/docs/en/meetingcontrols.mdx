Once inside the meeting, slide content will be presented in sync with the presenter's screenshare. When a new slide presents itself, the following will happen:
1. You will heara beep.
1. The content will present itself onscreen and be read out by an existing screen reader.

## Meeting Controls and Functions

Scribe for Meetings offers several ways to control the rendering. These clickable buttons have easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts as well. Controls include:
* Suspend Presentation: Pauses the live presentation, holding your place at the currently displayed slide.      
    * Although new slides will not be announced in real-time, you will not miss out as Scribe for Meetings is still silently watching the presentation for updates.
    * When a presentation is suspended, this control turns into a "go Live" button.
* Previous Slide: Goes to the previous displayed slide, if one is available.
    * If there is no previous slide, this button will not appear.
    * Pressing this button will suspend the live presentation.
    * Note that if you attend a meeting and the presentation is already underway, this button will not be able to take you back to slide 1.
* Next Slide: Goes to the next slide, if one is available.
    * If you are already viewing the latest slide, this button will not appear.
    * Pressing this button will suspend the live presentation.
* Read Aloud: Begins reading the currently focused slide using the system's text to speech voice.
    * Initiating the read aloud mode will make additional transport controls (rewind, play/pause, and fast forward buttons) as well as buttons to slow down or speed up the speech.
* Download slides: Allows you to download the slides in several different formats.
    * This option only shows if the organizer has allowed the slides to be downloaded.
