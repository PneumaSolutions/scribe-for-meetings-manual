Once inside the meeting, slide content will be presented in sync with the presenter's screenshare. When a new slide presents itself, the following will happen:
1. You will heara beep.
1. The content will present itself onscreen and be read out by an existing screen reader.

### Meeting Controls and Functions

Scribe for Meetings offers several ways to control the rendering. These clickable buttons have easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts as well. Controls include:
* Suspend Presentation: Pauses the live presentation, holding your place at the currently displayed slide.      
    * Although new slides will not be announced in real-time, you will not miss out as Scribe for Meetings is still silently watching the presentation for updates.
    * When a presentation is suspended, this control turns into a "go Live" button.
* Previous Slide: Goes to the previous displayed slide, if one is available.
    * If there is no previous slide, this button will not appear.
    * Pressing this button will suspend the live presentation.
    * Note that if you attend a meeting and the presentation is already underway, this button will not be able to take you back to slide 1.
* Next Slide: Goes to the next slide, if one is available.
    * If you are already viewing the latest slide, this button will not appear.
    * Pressing this button will suspend the live presentation.
* Read Aloud: Begins reading the currently focused slide using the system's text to speech voice.
    * Initiating the read aloud mode will reveal additional transport controls (rewind, play/pause, and fast forward buttons) as well as buttons to slow down or speed up the speech.
* Download slides: Allows you to download the slides in several different formats.
    * This option only shows if the organizer has allowed the slides to be downloaded.

### Downloading slides

Provided the organizer has allowed for slides to be downloaded, Scribe for Meetings offers downloads of the slides in several accessible formats. In order to download slides, follow the below procedure:
1. while in a meeting, activate the "Download Slides" link.
	1. If you are not logged in, you will be asked for your email address, at which point you will be emailed a verification link.
	1. Clicking this link will log you in, thus continuing the download preparation process.
1. Choose the file format you would like your slides to be presented as. Your options include:
    * An accessible web page, with all of the same features as the live presentation, including read aloud
    * Tagged PDF
        * Supports large print
    * MP3, via text-to-speech in about a dozen languages
        * Additional settings for voice and speaking rate are offered with this conversion.
    * DAISY, text plus audio
        * Additional settings for voice and speaking rate are offered with this conversion.

1. Clicking the link will instantly begin the download.

### Keyboard Command Reference

*Note for macOS VoiceOver users*: If you are using the Chrome browser, your modifiers will be CTRL and Option. This will unfortunately cause a conflict with VoiceOver unless the passthrough command (CTRL+Option+Tab) is used before entering commands.
