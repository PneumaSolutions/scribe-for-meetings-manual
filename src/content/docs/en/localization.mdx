Remote Incident Manager currently ships with 6 major languages, with more being added over time. If your system locale is among RIM's supported languages, RIM will use the language you specified.

# Switching languages

Whether you are in controller or target mode, Remote Incident Manager displays a language selector button at the bottom of the screen. Clicking this will display a list of languages. Select the desired language, and then click the "Switch language" button.

# additional Languages

We welcome contributions of additional languages from individuals and entities alike. For information on how to contribute languages, [Visit the Localization repository on Github](https://github.com/PneumaSolutions/rim-localization)
