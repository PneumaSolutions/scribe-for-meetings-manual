title: Setting Up Accessible Meetings
---

Whether done well in advance or within minutes of the meeting's start time, the setup process is quick and efficient. The procedure for starting the meeting will vary slightly depending on your role.

## If you are the Organizer

1. Login to your Scribe for Meetings account, if you have not done so already.
1. Enter the invite link for the meeting, then click "Go."
1. You will land on a page informing you that this meeting has yet to be registered with Scribe for Meetings. When asked how you would like to proceed, click on "Click here if you are the organizer of this event." AS you are the event organizer, you will be able to run the registration process through to completion.
1. Enter a meeting title in the "Title" edit box.
	1. Note that this does not have to be the title of the meeting in your video conferencing platform.
1. To upload your slides, click on "Browseâ€¦No file selected." A standard file browser window will appear where you can select your PowerPoint or PDF file.
	1. Note: while PowerPoint support is complete, PDF support is currently in beta.
1. These next settings are optional. You may skip past them and click "Done" if desired.
	1. You will be presented a language dropdown, useful if you wish to manually enforce the language instead of using the automatic language detection.
	1. You will be asked if you wish to have images automatically described.
		1. Note that Scribe's image description will only attempt to describe images that lack alt text.
	1. Lastly, you will be asked if you wish to allow the downloading of slides.
1. Once you click "Done," Scribe will process the slides for your meeting. A percentage bar will report progress on this.
1. Once the slides have been processed, you will be given the chance to copy a message containing the Scribe for Meetings participant link to the clipboard. You should post this in the meeting chat, in an email to your participants, or via any other accessible means.
1. Within a few minutes of the participant clicking the link and initiating the join process, the Scribe Bot will attempt to join your meeting. If you have a waiting room, you will need to allow the bot entry into your meeting manually once you receive the alert from your video conferencing platform. In either case, the Scribe Bot will patiently await your screenshare.
1. Launch slideshow mode in your presentation program, then share the slideshow window to your meeting participants. Any meeting participants with Scribe for Meetings loaded in their browser will begin hearing the accessible slides.

## If you are not the organizer:

Meetings can be set up on behalf of the organizer, who will then be able to upload the slides.
1. Login to your Scribe for Meetings account, if you have not done so already.
1. Enter the invite link for the meeting, then click "Go."
1. You will land on a page informing you that this meeting has yet to be registered with Scribe for Meetings. When asked how you would like to proceed, click on "Click here if you want to register this event on behalf of the organizer."
1. Give the meeting a title.
1. You will be asked if you wish to have images automatically described.
1. Once you click "Done," you will be given a message that you can copy to your clipboard and send to the person in charge of slides. Once they click the link and upload the slides, they can decide whether or not to allow slides to be downloaded.
