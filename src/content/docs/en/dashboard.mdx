Scribe  for Meetings features a  web-based dashboard to facilitate various meeting, account and organization management tasks.
It should be noted that the feature set of the dashboard is largely dependent on whether you are a user or an admin.

### Meeting Management

The meetings section lists all the meetings, past and present, facilitated by you and/or your organization. Clicking on a meeting opens a details page which allows you to:
* Upload a new or revised slide deck
* Delete your existing slide deck
* Access the link to the meeting
* View how many participants have entered the meeting using Scribe for Meetings (admin)

Clicking the "Delete" link next to a meeting will ask for confirmation, then delete the meeting from your account.

### Attendance Statistics (admin)

The attendance statistics section gives you a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and all time count of all the unique users attending meetings using Scribe for Meetings under your organization.

### Meeting Defaults (admin)

The Meeting Defaults page, located under the Settings menu, allows you to set global defaults that persist across all meetings. They include:
* Language
* Automatic image description preference
* Whether to allow the downloading of slides

### Managing Organization Members (Enterprise)

Activating the "Organization" button in the dashboard's navigation bar will reveal a menu of options related to organization and member management. The "Members" page will list all the members in your organization. All members can have their role, department and name modified, and any member can be deactivated or removed from an organization except for the organization owner. Note that deactivating a member will render their account inoperable while retaining its record.

#### Adding Members

Adding members is as simple as entering their email address, selecting their role (user or administrator), optionally entering their name, and selecting their department if one has been created.
If you have multiple members to add, you can use the "Members" edit field to perform a bulk add. This edit field accepts multiple lines of text, allowing you to enter each member's information on a separate line. On each line, you may enter either a single email address, or an email address and a name in the format:  
*email@example.com John Doe*

Once you are finished, click the "Add" button. 

#### Departments

Departments allow you to organize members according to the various groups of your organization.

To add a department, enter its name in the "Name" edit box under the "Create department" heading.

#### Member Data export

The member list in your organization can be exported as a CSV file. In order to download the export:
1. Choose the field separator that will separate the columns of the file. The available options include:
    * comma
    * Semicolon
    * Tab
1. Activate the "Download" button.
