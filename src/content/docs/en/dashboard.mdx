Scribe  for Meetings features a  web-based dashboard to facilitate various meeting, account and organization management tasks.
It should be noted that the feature set of the dashboard is largely dependent on whether you are a user or an admin.

### Meeting Management

The meetings section lists all the meetings, past and present, facilitated by you and/or your organization. Clicking on a meeting opens a details page which allows you to:
* Upload a new or revised slide deck
* Delete your existing slide deck
* Access the link to the meeting
* View how many participants have entered the meeting using Scribe for Meetings (admin)

Clicking the "Delete" link next to a meeting will ask for confirmation, then delete the meeting from your account.

### Attendance Statistics (admin)

The attendance statistics section gives you a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and all time count of all the unique users attending meetings using Scribe for Meetings under your organization.

### Meeting Defaults (admin)

The Meeting Defaults page, located under the Settings menu, allows you to set global defaults that persist across all meetings. They include:
* Language
* Automatic image description preference
* Whether to allow the downloading of slides

### Organization Management (admin)

Clicking the "Organization" button reveals a "Members" link. This page allows you to add members to the organization, as well as manage existing members.

#### Adding Members

To add a member, simply enter their email into the "email Address" box, select their role in the dropdown, then click the "add" button.

#### Managing Existing users

Next to each user, there are two buttons. One allows you to switch their role, while the other deletes them from the organization.
