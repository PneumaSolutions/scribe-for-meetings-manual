# Getting Connected

Scribe for Meetings offers several quick, painless ways to connect to your accessible slide presentation.

## Direct Link

Similar to a meeting link from your teleconference platform, Scribe for Meetings offers direct links for joining your accessible slide presentation. If you receive one in your meeting invite or the meeting chat, you can click on it to instantly open Scribe for Meetings in your web browser. Once you click the "Start" button, one of two things may happen.
1. You will hear a short chime, followed by a message informing you that Scribe for Meetings is preparing to provide access to the content in this meeting.
    1. It is normal for this to take up to three minutes, hence why it may be advisable for the meeting presenter to initialize Scribe for Meetings in advance of presenting their slides.
    1. Once the Scribe Bot joins the meeting, you will receive a second alert chime followed by a message alerting you of this fact.
1. You may sometimes start hearing slide content being announced very shortly after clicking on "Start." This could happen if:
    1. You are not the first visually impaired participant to enter the meeting.
    1. You entered a meeting late.

In any case, Scribe for Meetings is now ready to start presenting the slides.
